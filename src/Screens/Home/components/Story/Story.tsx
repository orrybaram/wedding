            Hanna and Orry met a little over 6 years ago at Cake Shop, a bar in
            the Lower East Side. On December 30th, 2018 Orry returned to their
            apartment after picking up outstanding items for their New Yearâ€™s
            Eve party. Pulling each item out one by one, the final piece from
            this show and tell was the ring. He got down on one knee and she
            said yes.

              They were married on June 29th, 2019 in a small ceremony in their
              backyard. And now, we party!
